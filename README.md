## 🔐 Database setup  for DVWA
<h2> Source of DVWA </h2>

```
https://github.com/digininja/DVWA
```


To set up the database, simply click on the `Setup DVWA` button in the main menu, then click on the `Create / Reset Database` button. This will create / reset the database for you with some data in.

If you receive an error while trying to create your database, make sure your database credentials are correct within `./config/config.inc.php`. *This differs from config.inc.php.dist, which is an example file.*

The variables are set to the following by default:

```php
$_DVWA[ 'db_server'] = '127.0.0.1';
$_DVWA[ 'db_port'] = '3306';
$_DVWA[ 'db_user' ] = 'dvwa';
$_DVWA[ 'db_password' ] = 'p@ssw0rd';
$_DVWA[ 'db_database' ] = 'dvwa';
```

Note, if you are using MariaDB rather than MySQL (MariaDB is default in Kali), then you can't use the database root user, you must create a new database user. To do this, connect to the database as the root user then use the following commands:

```mysql
mysql> create database dvwa;
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> create user dvwa@localhost identified by 'p@ssw0rd';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)

mysql> grant all on dvwa.* to dvwa@localhost;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)

mysql> flush privileges;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
```
